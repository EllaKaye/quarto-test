Some inline code: `x <- y`, `x != g0`. `1/2` `m^2`

`---` `{|` `<=`

`&#25D4;` `U+25D4`

Some code:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>%
  mutate(
    long_flipper = case_when(
      species == "Adelie" & flipper_length_mm > 195 ~ TRUE,
      species == "Chinstrap" & flipper_length_mm > 200 ~ TRUE,
      species == "Gentoo" & flipper_length_mm > 225 ~ TRUE,
      TRUE ~ FALSE
    )
  )

x <- 1/2 
TRUE != FALSE # a comment

```

A plot (too much whitespace):

```{r fig-colour-theory-palette, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Colours for syntax highlighting, starting from my main pink, based only on colour theory", fig.alt="A swatch of five colours, very bright and vibrant shades of pink, orange, green, blue and purple."}
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.height: 1
library(colorspace)
ek_pure_highlight_colours <- c("#D4006A", "#D46A00", "#00D46A", "#006AD4", "#6A00D4")
swatchplot(ek_pure_highlight_colours, border = "transparent") 
# Using the above code gives too much white around the swatches, so I ran the code, took a screen shot to crop it, then include that image back in.
#knitr::include_graphics("first-colour-swatch.png")
```
